## An on-demand task completion service app for college students

Ever been furiously working to meet a deadline and not had the time to grab food or coffee? Ever been too overloaded with exams or just too plain tired to do simple chores like laundry and dishes? Ever wanted to make some money in college but didn't have the time to commit to a steady job? If you fit any of the above criteria, Simplr is the app for you.

Simplr was my group final project for User Interfaces and Mobile Applications and is a task completion application for Android phones that connects users with Johns Hopkins ID's such that people can submit requests for simple tasks to be completed and have others accept these jobs in exchange for money. It uses a Firebase backend and integrates with PayPal for payment processing.

Work is still in progress but bugs should be ironed out in the next few days.
